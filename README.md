# MLOpsClass01
In this project, I developed a script in Python that uses Open AI's speech-to-text technology to transcribe audio from wave file.
The script is intended to be run on Google Colaboratory IDE 
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hBXiLUvLuHfOajvdRGgiYLuraOUAtkeW

Pre Conditions:
Project is live till 27-07-2024 1pm
Internet and any web browser is needed
For transcribe / TTS, input audio file must be a wave file with sample rate of 16Khz and preferred quantization is PCM / ADPCM with 8/16/32/Float resolutions

# Usage:
 Run the notebook in Colab (make sure you are logged into Colab with your Google account).
>>> Run all cells (shortcut: `CTRL + F9`)
>>> GPU is preferred
>>> Microphone option is optional (experimental)
